# Ciao-Crawler

This is a crawler that scoured the since-deconstructed Ciao online retail service, and collected information to be used for data visualization and interpretation to navigate trust on this user network. The crawler was implemented using Python and incorporated the use of regular expressions heavily by exploring the HTML scripting of the files.
